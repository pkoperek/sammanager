Semantic-based Autonomic Monitoring and Management
(SAMM) is a proof of concept of an automatic, autonomous system capable of
managing a computing environment. It utilizes some unique ideas:
  * Resources types and relationships between them are internally held in form of an ontology.
  * System operation is based on  the terms of an SLA contract.
  * Knowledge about how the speciﬁc application works is gathered and future  behavior/measurements are estimated. These information are used later on to optimize the whole cost of system operation.
  * Interaction with observed system by executing actions which change an environment’s conﬁguration.

The project is a result of Master’s Thesis project called:

_Autonomic semantic - based management for distributed applications_
_(AGH University of Science and Technology, Kraków 2010)_
